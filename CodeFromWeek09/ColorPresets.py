Color Presets
'''
#Because I like moving the color stuff over to other files. Keeps it modular, neat, and tidy. For I shall seperate all into bite sized bits.

#With such ease I shall alter the colors you percieve. For now it does not matter what colors I have. If they suck, it is no problem anymore.
BG = '#11121e' #Background
TWB = '#41726c' #Text Widget Background. Also Currently Used For Listbox's too.
BB = '#2d2d2d' #Button Background
TB = '#FFFFFF' #Text Background, and I have realized now that it should be called TC for text color, but that would require going through the code and replacing every TB, which defeats the point of this entire python file, which is to not need to go to every widget and change every seperate thing.
FT = '#ffffff' #Frozen Text, recoloring so that the user has indication on whats listed is frozen. Same as TB for now, but can change.

#Font Settings

Dfu = ('Arial', 10, 'bold') #Default
