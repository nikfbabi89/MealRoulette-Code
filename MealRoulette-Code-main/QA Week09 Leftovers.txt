QA Report:

Version October 9 Project File (from Slack)

2. "Filtered Meals show up in Selected Meals"
Clicking on an entry to add to "Selected Meals" from "Meals List" and then right-clicking to "filter that meal out" continues to show the entry on the "Selected Meals"

Expected result:
Right-clicking on an entry should also temporarily remove the item from "Selected meals"

3. Using arrow keys does not update the "Info Box"
Info box is only updated when a meal is added to the "Selected Meals".

Expected result:
Whatever is currently highlighted should be on the info box. Clicking on Popcorn and then using the downarrow so the highlight is on Tacos should have the info box show the Tacos information


5. Info Box incorrect information *Randomized
There is extraneous information that should not be shown

6. Info Box Misnamed "Id's"
Id's should be renamed to "Tag"
Current:
Popcorn
ID's['Snack']['Quick']
Expected:
Popcorn
Tags[Snack][Quick]

7. Info Box Formatting
7.1) Quotations should be removed when possible
7.2) [Brackets] should be 1 per attribute
Example Current for Popcorn:
Ingredients: ['Corn', 'Salt', 'Oil']
Id's['Snack'] ['Quick']
Expected for Popcorn:
Ingredients: [Corn] [Salt] [Oil]
Id's[Snack] [Quick]

8. Filters are seperate and cumbersome
Filters are needed to be applied in a seperate tab. There is no feedback on the mainscreen for what filters are applied. There is indication of what meals are available for selection (the "Selected Meals" is empty and does not populate when filters are added")

9. Unable to add new meals

10. Unable to edit meals

11. Unable to delete meals

12. Time Filter is not present

13. Filters are not re-arrangeable
They are also not alphabetized OR grouped by category

14. Roulette is not showing what meals were available for selection
Select no meals, and apply no filters. Randomizer will show a random meal. It does not show what meals were available for selection or which ones were not available for selection

17. Filters tab - Logical error
Filter can both be a whitelist and blacklist
