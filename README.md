About Meal Roulette:<br>
-Meal roulette is an app designed to help users select a random meal from a selection. <br>
-Users can use whitelist/blacklist filters to narrow down this selection, by using custom tags such as [quick] or [grill]. <br>
-Meals can also be given a special override such as "freeze" which will always remove the meal from the valid selection<br>
